# Five Things You Need Before Starting With ROS

Video: [Five Things You Need Before Starting With ROS | Getting Ready to Build Robots with ROS #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lIV3dRvHmQ)

## Required Skills

* Admin
* Linux
* Git
* Compiling
* Electronics

## Required Computers

* Raspberry PI - Robot's On-Board Computer (not initially required, can be simulated)
* PC/Laptop - Robot Base Station; Development & Simulation

## Required OS

Ubuntu LTS. (As of 2025, the required version is Ubuntu LTS 24.04, because that version is required by ROS 2 Jazzy Jelasco. While Windows and macOS are also supported, the official tutorials will be more difficult to follow and some things will be missing. On a Macbook M1 Pro with 16 GB memory, running ROS2, including graphical simulations, works well using VMware Fusion.)

## Git

Use git to synchronize code between computers (pi, base station, dev).Synchronizing code between 2 or more computers is straigtforward if you use a remote repository like GitHub.

Git is not needed to complete the official [Beginner: CLI tools](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html) Tutorial.

## Visual Studio Code

Recommends "Remote Development" extension for VS Code.
