# TODO

* Figure out how to use SSH keys stored in 1Password for ubuntu-2404 and raspberrypi.
* Install 1Password when possible. See <https://support.1password.com/install-linux/#debian-or-ubuntu>.
* Install ROS2 Docker container on raspberry pi 3 model b.
* Check out machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or OpenCV. ChatGPT says:

> • Computer Vision (e.g., OpenCV, YOLO, TensorFlow): Helps the robot recognize objects, detect obstacles, and understand its surroundings.
>
> • Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Stable-Baselines3, RLlib): Lets the robot learn from trial and error to navigate or complete tasks efficiently.

>A common approach is to start with vision-based navigation (using SLAM + object detection) and then introduce reinforcement learning to optimize movement strategies.

## Done

* Check out Visual Studio Code Extension for ROS.
